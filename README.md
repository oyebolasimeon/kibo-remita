# Remita
In this project you are to practice how to write HTML and CSS. You will be building a replication of a remita page. Screenshots for the page has been added to the starter file. So here are your tasks:

 **_Please read the following tasks carefully before starting_** 

- You have been provided with screenshots of the page you are about to build, go through it to have an idea of what you are about to build
- The index file is already linked to the style file for you 
- Start writing your code the index file and style it in the style file
- Make sure your output is exactly what is in the screenshot
- The remita logo has been added to the starter file. Make sure you link it well when writing your code
- If you get stuck, check w3schools online or other online resources to fix your code
- You dont need to worry about the reponsiveness for now

Use starter code to start the task, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!
